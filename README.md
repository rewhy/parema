# A aramework for investigating VM-based Android packers

In this project, we proposed a novel framework to investigate the VM-based Android packers with the following advantagesï¼š

1) An cross-layer dyanmic intrumention approach for monitor the behaviors of VMs;
2) An novel symbolic-based approach to reverse-engineer the customized VMs;
3) An new semantic analysis approach to recognize the semantics of the new customized bytecode.
